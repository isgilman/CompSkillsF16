# Homework 0 Getting Started

In this assignment gives you will set up your account for using github to keep up with class activities, and you will read up on the materials we will cover in lectures 1 and 2. The sooner you do these, the better you will be prepared for class.

## Changes from other versions of HW0

Homework files are now in the public course repository.

1. So, there is no separate homework repository. If you have already created one, feel free to *rmdir* to remove it from the computer.
2. You will turn in homework in a private repository for just you and me. So, you will not be able to see and comment on each others work directly in the repos.

## Things to do before end of class, **Thursday 30 August (class 3)**, or sooner

You will maintain two remote repositories: one for class information (including homework assignments and materials) and one for private communications with me. The first is a public repo (meaning anyone in the world can see it, but only I and Ian can change it). The private repo is just for you and me.

1. Sign up for a github account (if you don’t already have one) at: https://github.com
Email me (foster@uidaho.edu) your github id. I need this before I can grant you access to the homework repository.

2. Create directories for the course

	a. Create ~/CompSkills_F16

	b. Create ~/CompSkills_F16/Information (or whatever name is meaningful for you, this is the class repo)

	c. Create ~/CompSkills_F16/MyHomework (or whatever makes sense to you, this will be our private repo)

3. Create ~/CompSkills_F16/Notes (or whatever makes sense to you, this is your own repo that you can sync with other devices)

4. Log into github.com and clone https://github.com/jamesafoster/CompSkillsF16 into your ~/CompSkills_F16/Information. This is where I will share course information (so be sure to keep it up to date!). This will make this directory a repository which will be attached to the public one on github.com

4. I will email you information about private repo where I will send you confidential information. You will clone that remote repo into ~/CompSkills_F16/MyHomework. You will turn in homework here, and I and Ian will add comments just to you.

5. (optional) Create a repo named “Class Notes” or whatever you want on your computer for ~/CompSkills_F16/Notes. This will be a place for you to keep notes and stuff you try out on your own. You can use this repo to sync your stuff with other computers, such as your own computer or your UI account. 
6. (optional) If you wish to work from other computers, link and fork to the github repos for Information, MyHomework, and your private repo. We will be using the class computers and accounts during class, but you can sync this work with other machines via these github repos.
